          <p> This policy is last updated on as of December 5, 2013. </p>
<p> This Privacy Policy is designed to help you
  understand how we collect and use the personal information you
  decide to share, and help you make informed decisions when using
  Teq Online PD (collectively, "teq.com" or
  "Website"). </p>
<p> By using or accessing Teq Online PD, you are
  accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. When you
  register to use a specific service offered by Teq. on the Website
  (“Service”), you may be subject to additional or
  different privacy terms that are specific to such Service. </p>
<p> The Information We Collect </p>
<p> When you visit teq.com, you may provide us with
  two types of information: personal information you knowingly
  choose to disclose, and usage information collected by us as you
  interact with our Website. </p>
<p> When you register, or are registered by your
  organization, for the Service, we may ask you to provide us with
  certain personal information, such as your name, your email
  address, the subject and grades that you teach (if applicable),
  your credentials (if applicable) and any other personal or
  preference information that you provide to us. </p>
<p> When you enter teq.com, we collect your browser
  type and IP address. This information is gathered for all teq.com
  visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your
  browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data
  stored on the user's computer tied to information about the
  user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged
  in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By
  default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but
  not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you
  come back to teq.com. You can remove or block this cookie using
  the settings in your browser if you want to disable this
  convenience feature.</p>
<p> When you use a certain Service, you may set up
  your personal profile, send messages, perform searches and
  queries, and transmit information through various channels. We
  collect this information so that we can provide you the service
  and offer personalized features. When you update information, we
  usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable
  period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that
  information. </p>
<p> You post User Content (as defined in the Terms of
  Use) on the Site at your own risk. We cannot control the actions
  of other Users with whom you may choose to share your pages and
  information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User
  Content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized
  persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy
  settings or security measures contained on the Site. You
  understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of
  User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or
  if other Users have copied or stored your User Content. </p>
<p> Any improper collection or misuse of information
  provided on teq.com is a violation of the teq.com Terms of Service
  and should be reported to: onlinepd@teq.com. </p>
<p> By using teq.com, you are consenting to have your
  personal data transferred to and processed in the United States. </p>
<p> Ineligible Users </p>
<p> Teq.com does not knowingly
  collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age
  of 18, or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are
  under 18, please do not attempt to register for teq.com or send
  any information about yourself to us, including your name,
  address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 18
  may provide any personal information to or on teq.com. </p>
<p> Use of Information Obtained by teq.com </p>
<p> When you or your organization registers you with
  teq.com, you may create your own profile. Your profile
  information, as well as your name, email address and photo, are
  displayed to people on teq.com to whom you chose to release such
  information to, for example, via a comment on a resource page. </p>
<p> Profile information is used by teq.com primarily
  to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the
  Service and to be presented to others permitted to view that
  information, like the administrator of your Teq Online PD
  subscription. </p>
<p> People who see your name, however, will not be
  able to access your profile information unless they the
  administrator of your Teq Online PD subscription. </p>
<p> We collect and use your personal information to
  customize your experience on our Site, to provide you with
  customer service, and access to our products and services, to
  respond to your requests for products or services, and to make a
  wider range of our products and services available to you. </p>
<p> Sharing Your Information with Third Parties </p>
<p> We do not provide your personal information to
  third party marketers without your permission. We share your
  information with third parties only in limited circumstances where
  we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the
  service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by you. For example: </p>
  <ul>
<li>We may provide information to
  service providers to help us bring you the services we offer.
  Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our
  business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility
  for servers, to send out email updates about teq.com, to remove
  repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments
  for products or services, or to provide search results or links
  (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings
  and business operations, our service providers may have access to
  your personal information for use for a limited time in
  connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third
  parties for the processing of any personal information, we
  implement reasonable contractual and technical protections
  limiting the use of that information to the teq.com-specified
  purposes.</li>
<li>We may use and distribute
  statistics based on your usage and other data and information as
  aggregated with our other users’ data for marketing and
  other purposes.</li>
<li>We may be required to disclose
  user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas
  or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not
  reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an
  information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets
  applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or
  other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with
  law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or
  other illegal activity perpetrated through the teq.com service or
  using the teq.com name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This
  may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers,
  agents or government agencies.</li>
</ul>
<p> When you use certain Services, the information you
  post or share with third parties, such as personal information,
  comments, messages, photos, videos or other information, may be
  shared with other users with whom you choose to interact. All such
  sharing of information is done at your own risk. Please keep in
  mind that if you disclose personal information in your profile or
  when posting comments, messages, or other items, this information
  may become publicly available. </p>
<p> Teq.com may use information in your profile
  without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do
  this for purposes such as aggregating how many people in a group
  have a particular set of skills or experience, and personalizing
  marketing and promotions. </p>
<p> Links </p>
<p> Teq.com may contain links
  to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the
  privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be
  aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of
  each and every web site that collects personally identifiable
  information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information
  collected by teq.com. </p>
<p> This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by
  teq.com and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking
  technologies by any of its advertisers. </p>
<p> Changing or Removing Information </p>
<p> Access and control over most personal information
  on teq.com is readily available through the profile editing tools.
  teq.com users may modify or delete any of their profile
  information at any time by logging into their account. Information
  will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate
  their teq.com account may do so on the profile page. Removed
  information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period
  of time but will not be generally available to members of teq.com. </p>
<p> Where you make use of the communication features
  of the service to share information with other individuals on
  teq.com, however, you generally cannot remove such communications. </p>
<p> Security </p>
<p> Teq.com takes appropriate
  precautions to protect our users' information. Your account
  information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. When
  you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or
  your password), we encrypt that information using secure socket
  layer technology (SSL). (To learn more about SSL, go to
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer). Because email
  and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications,
  we request that you not send private information to us by email or
  instant messaging services. If you have any questions about the
  security of teq.com Web Site, please contact us at
  onlinepd@teq.com. </p>
<p> Terms of Use, Notices and Revisions </p>
<p> Your use of teq.com, and any disputes arising from
  it, is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use
  and all of its dispute resolution provisions including
  arbitration, limitation on damages and choice of law. We reserve
  the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any
  time. Non-material changes and clarifications will take effect
  immediately, and material changes will take effect within 30 days
  of their posting on this site. If we make changes, we will post
  them and will indicate at the top of this page the policy's
  new effective date. If we make material changes to this policy, we
  will notify you by email, or through notice on our home page. We
  encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that
  you understand our current privacy policy. Unless stated
  otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information
  that we have about you and your account. </p>

  policy, please contact us at 7 Norden Lane, Huntington Station, NY
